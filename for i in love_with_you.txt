Experts say
Only juns rush in
But I can't help
Sharing my code
With you

Shall I send
The collab request?
If I can't help
Granting access
To you

Like the git flow goes
Surely to release
Darling, take the creds
For all my DBs

Query dev
Query staging too
For I can't help
Giving all rights
To you

Like the ticket goes
Surely to QAs
Darling, I approve
All your pull requests

Take my dev
Take my whole live too
For I can't help
Sharing all envs
With you

For I can't help
Sharing my code
With you
